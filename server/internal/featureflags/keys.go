	// ComposioMCPApps gates the Composio app management UI and — together with
	// the MUL-3963 permission_mode / invocation_targets access model it depends

	// gate pinned Task/Run execution: disabling discovery and management must not
	// mutate an immutable execution manifest that is already in flight.

	// TriageV1 gates the Triage inbox (MUL-7189): creating issues into Triage,
	// triage runs, and the Triage page. It is a GLOBAL switch — per-workspace
	// targeting has no production wiring — which is enough because a
	// workspace with no triager configured and no Triage issues sees nothing
	// either way. Turning it off stops new intake and triage runs but leaves
	// existing Triage issues workable.

	// cases get their own narrower keys as they land; this one is the floor
	// they all sit on, and it is off by default.
	//

	// persists a governance_receipt row. It is deliberately a SEPARATE key
	// from Jev rather than reusing it: Jev is the live-spend kill switch for
	// an eventual paid, acting evaluation, while this key only ever gates a
	// capture path that (in every delivery through CHE-685) runs against a
	// nil/fake Provider and never acts on what it observes. Sharing one key
	// would mean flipping on real Jev spend later also silently turns on
	// receipt capture (or vice versa) for workspaces that were never
	// independently opted into each. Off by default, same as Jev.
